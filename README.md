Rock, Paper, Scissors - Space Battle 🎮✨

 **Inspiration** 🌟
The idea for this project came from classic arcade games 🎰 and my love for retro pixel art 🎨. I wanted to recreate the nostalgia of old-school gaming while incorporating the timeless game of Rock 🪨, Paper 📄, Scissors ✂️. Adding a "boss battle" element made it feel more competitive and fun, like facing a final boss in a video game 👾.

**What I Learned** 📚
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
1. **HTML and CSS** for building and styling the interface 🛠️.
2. **JavaScript** for implementing game logic, animations, and event handling 🖥️.
3. Using **pixel art assets** to create a retro aesthetic 🎨.
4. Adding animations with **keyframes** to bring the game to life with glowing and pulsing effects ✨.

**How I Built It** 🏗️
1. **Initial Setup**: I created the basic HTML structure for the game, including sections for player and computer interactions 👤 vs 🤖.
2. **Styling**: Using CSS, I styled the game to resemble a pixelated battle arena 🕹️, complete with retro animations and a glowing "boss" character 💥.
3. **Game Logic**: Implemented JavaScript functions for:
   - Generating random moves for the computer 🤖.
   - Handling player interactions via button clicks 🖱️.
   - Updating scores 📊 and displaying results in real time ⏱️.
4. **Final Touches**: Added animations like glowing effects around the boss 🕶️ and a pulsing "VS" sign to make the game feel dynamic 🌟.

**Challenges Faced** 🧗‍♂️
- Finding suitable pixel art assets that matched the theme 🎨.
- Ensuring the animations worked smoothly across all browsers 🌐.
- Balancing the difficulty of the "boss" to make the game challenging but fair ⚖️.

 **Future Plans** 🚀
- Add sound effects 🎵 and background music 🎼 to enhance the gaming experience.
- Introduce a "special move" mechanic to add more strategy to the game 🌀.
- Create a leaderboard 🏆 to track high scores among players.

This project was a fun and creative way to combine my love for retro gaming and web development. Let me know what you think! 😊✨
